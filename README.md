# USACO
 - For the USACO, you MUST add fstream and freopen for the code to work on [USACO](usaco.org)! 
 - However, if you are inputting it onto a site such as [AlphaStar's LMS] (lms.alphastar.academy/) you don't need that extra code.
 - DO NOT copy the code and call it yours.
 
# Utilities
 - Here, you can find many things that can help you such as.

1. Calculator
